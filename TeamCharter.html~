	<P>WE THE PEOPLE reserve the right to not surrender
our right to reach a consensus amongst ourselves before submitting to any ex-
ternal will that might impose on our freedom of choice; our wills bend for no
dictator with an iron fist.
<p>
We acknowledge that clients have necessary demands and so shall they be met
as long as they be met within reason (subject to the previous provision).
<p>
We will test the functionality of our code to our satisfaction where, at the very
least, every critical feature will be subject to at least a few test cases.
<p>
We will avoid dissociation among ourselves by maintaining contact through e-
mail between intervals of at most 16 hours. Similarly, we will hold two weekly
meetings, one of which will include the product champion and the other of which
will occur among ourselves during tutorial. We will otherwise meet on Mondays
at 11. In case of an immediate concern, we will call send a text message to one
another to immediately gather the groupâ€™s collective attention.
<P>
With a complete list of user stories we will set and maintain deadlines within
respective sprints so as to keep a consistent momentum.
<P>
We stress the importance of honesty especially in the face of any sort of hiccup
during the scrum process; it will be more useful to immediately admit to needing
support from the other team members than to fail silently and fracture the team.
