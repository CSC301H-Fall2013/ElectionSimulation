      <h3><p>Election Master, Jonathan Edwards<p>
      <p>Age:35<p></h3>
      <img src="images/Election_Master_Jonathan_Edwards.png" width="200" height="250">
      <p>Jonathan Edwards is a 35-year-old, male, Election Master. He is more of a
behind-the-scenes kind of worker, focused, always determined, and very skilled. He is also
usually very underappreciated. Jonathan is married to a lovely wife of the same age, with no
children to his name. She is one of the few people who truly appreciates his efforts. Jonathan
lives with his wife in a flat in downtown Toronto where when he arrives after a long day of
work has a very comfortable, relaxing evening with his wife. Jonathan is mostly estranged
from his family and his parents are unfortunately no longer alive. His family drifted after their
departures when they got into a feud over his parents' will. Jonathan is content to not have to
be around what he calls his 'money-sucking relatives'.
His hobbies include disassembling software and reading up on Machine Learning ever
since he started to study the topic. Jonathan initially accepted his job as his party's Election
Master because of the appreciation and responsibilities he assumed being a 'master' would
afford him. He was wrong, it was really a fluffed up title for a lowly technician to configure the
technology for his party. Strangely enough, he tried to avoid politics most of his life anyways,
but jumped at the opportunity to help people where his surrounding colleagues saw human
virtue as political vice. Jonathan works full time: a total of 65 hours every week. The pay is
good. No matter how much his underappreciated self gets battered after a long work shift, he
knows not to transfer his anguish to his wife. He's been working at the position for three years,
with hopes of moving up the ranks with his new-found knowledge of how politics work.
Jonathan is very fond of technology. He became computer literate at a very young age,
anticipating that it would change the way everything gets done, and boy was he right.. He is
also very skilled with computers and became relatively good at disassembling software so
much that he can modify underlying assembly code and still yet understand what he's doing.
Since Jonathan is so skilled with application dis-assembly, he never really needs too much of
an accessible GUI he only desires that the parameters that he needs to be specified can be
easily inferred. In this case, as the Election Master, he would like a system that he could use
to accurately predict a mapping of his party's effort to the results at the polls with an
easily-specifiable and thorough set of parameters. Though Jonathan likes reading on Machine
Learning, he is still new to the topic so he would need this prediction model to be
preprogrammed.</P>

   <h3><p>Player/Presenter, Linda Johnson née Daniels<p> <p>Age 45<p></h3>
   <img src="images/player_linda.png" width="200" height="250">
<p>Linda is 50 years old and a lifelong Canadian citizen. She grew up in Oakville, Ontario, but has
lived closer to downtown Toronto since graduating high school. She graduated from York University with
a degree in Sociology and has a keen interest in politics.
Linda has been happily married for sixteen years to Derek, an accountant for a major Canadian
bank. She had been employed full-time as an administrator for a small non-profit organization until the
birth of their only child, Matthew, age 14. She chose to quit, in light of the high expense and low
availability of quality daycare in the city. She enjoys having lots of quality time with her son, but would
be open to returning to work full-time if the opportunity arose. Linda’s parents still live in Oakville, and
enjoy it when Linda and her family visit on the long weekends. Like her son, Linda was an only child.
Linda has a very outgoing personality. She enjoys meeting new people and trying new things.
She values the relationships she made at university, and still makes time to meet with her old friends on
a regular basis. Now that her son is a little more self-sufficient, Linda has taken advantage of an
opportunity to work part-time for her political party of choice. Her job is to present statistical data to
politicians and public figures, in an effort to show the merits of electoral reform in Canada. This job plays
to her public speaking and communication skills, and she’s relished the chance to advocate for
something that she holds quite dear.
Linda wakes up at 7:00 each morning to help get Derek and Matthew on their way. She packs a
lunch for each of them after a cup of coffee and a brief look through that day’s newspaper. After they’ve
left, she does the grocery shopping and plans dinner for the evening. She hates doing the shopping after
work, as the lines are always significantly longer. Unless there is a meeting or presentation to attend,
she aims to arrive at work at 10:00 each morning, and stay until around 4. She spends the majority of
her day arranging meetings and working with the “election master” to build specialized presentationsfor each of them. After coming home and preparing dinner with help from her husband, she has a good
amount free time in the evening for reading and watching television.
Linda has a positive relationship with technology. She was a reluctant adopter of personal
computers but values the convenience of things like email and Office applications. She recently
upgraded to a smartphone, and is gradually adapting to the touchscreen controls. She values ease of use
and user-friendliness in her applications, and isn’t too proud to ask for help when her electronic devices
are experiencing problems, but she is often able to figure things out on her own. She has a tablet, and
enjoys it for reading books.
Linda needs an application with a simple, user-friendly interface and, more importantly, she
needs it to produce attractive graphics and represent data in an easy-to-understand fashion. This is
more for the sake of her audience than for her.<p>
