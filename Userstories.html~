As Jonathan, I would like to modify the formula used to calculate the simulation, so that different strategies.
<p class="testCase1">Test Case:
<ul><li>Modify the formula with same data input, to see if the result is changed and correct
</li></ul>
<p>

As Jonathan, I can select the parties of all the candidates, so that I can reflect the most realistic political spectrum.
<p>

As Jonathan, I can select the set of ridings, so that I can have a focus research on certain ridings.
<p>

As Jonathan, I can select the total number of candidates, so that I can simulate different ridings without any restriction of number of candidates.
<p>

As Jonathan, I can select the voting system will be run, so that I can do simulations on different voting systems.
<p>

As Jonathan, I would like to add/delete users, so that each user will have different privileges.
<p class="testCase1">Test Case:
<ul><li>add a user, try logging in with the new user
</li><li>add a user without privileges, try to see if they can operate functions that requires such privileges
</li><li>delete a user, try to log back in with the deleted account
</li></ul>
<p>

As Jonathan, I can select election area on the map, so that I modify the election environment according to specific requirements.

As Jennifer, I would like to have a "one-button-installation" and load the database automatically, so that it's easier for me to use and install on different computers.
<p class="testCase1">Test Case:
<ul><li>Click on the "button" to see if everything is installed
</ul></li>
<p>

<p>

As Linda, I can press a button to start the simulation, so that all the simulated data will be computed and store in temperately memory for preview.
<p>

As Linda, I can press a button to save the simulation result, so that I can keep it for the future reference.
<p>

As Linda, I can manage the historical simulation record by deleting or rearranging the results, so that I can keep the result database small and accurate.
<p>

As Linda, I can load the previous result for the new simulation, so that I can reduce the unnecessary duplicate work. 
<p>

As Linda, I can track the simulation result by time order, so that I can see the trend with some variable changing in the election.
<p>

As Linda, I would like to have a search button, so that I can find the data without reading through everything.
<p class="testCase1">Test Case:
<ul><li>		Search for an existing data, see if it can find it
</li><li>		Search for an non-existing data, see if it has no bug
</li></ul>
<p>

As Linda, I can preview the simulation results, so that I can get an estimated view without having to generate a fancy report.
<p>

As Linda, I would like to add or delete data, so that the current demographic is up to date.
<p class="testCase1">	Test Cases:
<ul><li>try adding data to the existing ones, and see if it is saved after exit
</li><li>try deleting data to the existing ones, and see if it is saved after exitup to date
</li></ul>
<p>

As Linda, I can select a map view, so that I can see the effort that each candidate put in some district. 
<p>

As Linda, I would like to export pictures or data, so that I can use those pictures or data in my report.
<p>

As Linda, I would like to show the election simulation result in dot plot graph or chart graph format, so that I can make my report more visualized and vivid.
<p>

As Linda, I would like to read data but not modify data, so that I donâ€™t need t worry about deleting data accidentally.
<p>

As Linda, I would like to divide the data in to different categories, so that I can check data by categories and do data analysis more easily.
<p>

As Linda, I would like to press a button to get in touch with election master or implementer, so that if I have any problem with the program, I could report it to them.
