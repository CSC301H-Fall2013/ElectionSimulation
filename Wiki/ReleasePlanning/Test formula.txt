We chose to simplify the formula by using the logistic regression,
where the weights would represent the relative proportion of voter
demographics necessary in the model.


Test 1: Using random proportions for demographics, does the model
properly return a number between the range [0, 1]?


Test 2: If we evenly distribute the proportions of the voter
demographics after evenly grouping the voters among parties
they could vote for, does the formula corroborate that the
candidate gets an even voter representation?


Test 3: Using as much data from a previous election as possible,
can we predict the same result as a previous election using the
same voter demographics as the model's parameters?
