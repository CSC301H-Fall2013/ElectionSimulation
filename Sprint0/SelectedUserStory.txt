As Jennifer, I would like to have a "one-button-installation" and load the database automatically, so that it's easier for me to use and install on different computers.
	-TestCase - manual only:
		-Click on the "button" to see if everything is installed
	-Estimation:
		-Story point 3
		-Time : 24 hours
