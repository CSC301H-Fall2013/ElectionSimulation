Implementer 1:
As Jennifer, I would like to have a "one-button-installation" and load the database automatically, so that it's easier for me to use and install on different computers.
	-TestCase - manual only:
	    Possitive test cases:
            -Get the install package
            -Run install.sh , need permission if any
            -Put in password for root access
            -Wait for the installation to finish
            -Check if http://greatbear.cloudapp.net/ has something to offer rather than errors
            -If yes then the test passes
        Negative test cases:
            -Run on non-linux os : this cannot run
            -No root access : this cannot install
	-Estimation:
		-Story point: 3
		-Time : 24 hours
