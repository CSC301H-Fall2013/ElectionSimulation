Before running the test suite, you have to make sure that the current Campaigns are empty, there are 3 formulas, each with the name 1, 2, 3 respectively, and there are 3 parties, each with the name 1, 2, 3 respectively. 


For the three test cases in their own separate folders (test_list_add_to_empty, for example), you have to move the database file into the proper directory (.../ElectionSimulation/Code). After, you just open the resepective html which will run the automated test case.
