Campaign master:
As a Campaign master, I can select the voting system will be run, so that I can do simulations on different voting systems
As a Campaign master, I can select the total number of candidates, so that I can simulate different ridings without any restriction of number of candidates
As a Campaign master, I can select the parties of all the candidates, so that I can reflect the most realistic political spectrum
As a Campaign master, I can select the set of ridings, so that I can have a focus research on certain ridings

As a Campaign master, I can press a button to start the simulation, so that all the simulated data will be computed and store in temperately memory for preview 

As a Campaign master, I can select a riding a riding on map then a certain year, so that I can see the demographic data of the current riding from the selected year

As a campaign master, I can select a map view, so that I can see the effort that each candidate put in some district.

Implementer:
As a implementer, I would like to add or delete data, so that the current demographic is up to date

As a implementer, I would like to add/delete users, so that each user will have different privileges

As a implementer, I would like to modify the formula used to calculate the simulation, since that different census track wants differently

As a implementer, I would like to set up/delete a new census track/riding in case of any changes in real life
