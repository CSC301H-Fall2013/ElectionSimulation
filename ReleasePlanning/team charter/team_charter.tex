{\Huge WE THE PEOPLE} reserve the right to not surrender our right to reach a consensus amongst ourselves before submitting to any external will that might impose on our freedom of choice; our wills bend for no dictator with an iron fist.\\

\noindent  We acknowledge that clients have necessary demands and so shall they be met as long as they be met within reason (subject to the previous provision).\\ 

\noindent We will test the functionality of our code to our satisfaction where, at the very least, every critical feature will be subject to at least a few test cases.\\

\noindent We will avoid dissociation among ourselves by maintaining contact through e-mail between intervals of at most 16 hours. Similarly, we will hold two weekly meetings, one of which will include the product champion and the other of which will occur among ourselves during tutorial. We will otherwise meet on Mondays at 11. In case of an immediate concern, we will call send a text message to one another to immediately gather the group's collective attention.\\

\noindent With a complete list of user stories we will set and maintain deadlines within respective sprints so as to keep a consistent momentum.\\

\noindent We stress the importance of honesty especially in the face of any sort of hiccup during the scrum process; it will be more useful to immediately admit to needing support from the other team members than to fail silently and fracture the team.\\
